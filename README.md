# Portfolio

This is a website to introduce myself and showcast my work. It has the about, work, and contact sections. This website should work on any screen size. In the work section, I have one working link and block, two non-working links and blocks to demonstrate when there is more than one project shown in the work section. Since I don't like the look of having empty spaces after the last element, I make sure the last element will scale and resize to fill out the empty space. In the most case, the first project list in the work section has a bigger size than the rest.
